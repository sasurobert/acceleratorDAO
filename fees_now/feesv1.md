# Comprehensive Economic Analysis of Fee Generation within the MultiversX DeFi Ecosystem (2025 Fiscal Year)

## 1\. Executive Summary and Macroeconomic Context

The fiscal year 2025 represented a watershed moment for the global decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, characterized by a transition from speculative liquidity mining cycles to sustainable, revenue-focused economic models. This report provides an exhaustive, forensic analysis of the fee generation mechanisms, capital efficiency, and revenue attribution within the MultiversX ecosystem over this twelve-month period. By synthesizing on-chain data, protocol-specific financial reports, and comparative industry benchmarks, this document establishes a precise economic baseline for the network’s performance.

Our primary objective is to quantify the "economic velocity" of the MultiversX network—specifically, how liquidity ($L$) translates into transaction volume ($V$), and subsequently, how that volume crystallizes into protocol fees ($F$). The analysis reveals that while MultiversX protocols maintain competitive technological infrastructure, boasting high throughput and low latency via Adaptive State Sharding, their fee capture mechanisms in 2025 were heavily influenced by a unique "Builder Royalty" model and a transitional liquidity landscape.

In 2025, the broader crypto market witnessed a surge in on-chain activity, particularly in the second half of the year, driven by the explosion of perpetual futures volumes which reached approximately $7.9 trillion globally.1 Against this backdrop, MultiversX initiated a radical transformation of its economic policy, shifting from a capped supply model to a dynamic, demand-driven inflation and burn mechanism designed to incentivize builders and secure a perpetual security budget.3 This report analyzes how these macro-level changes trickled down to the micro-economics of specific DeFi primitives: Liquid Staking, Lending Markets, and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).

The investigation highlights a stark dichotomy: while the "Store of Value" and "Passive Income" verticals (Liquid Staking and Lending) demonstrated resilience and consistent fee generation, the "Active Velocity" verticals (Spot and Perpetual Trading) significantly lagged behind industry peers like Uniswap and Hyperliquid. This report breaks down these disparities using rigorous mathematical models and monthly accumulated fee projections, providing a granular view of the ecosystem's financial health.

## 2\. MultiversX Economic Architecture: The 2025 Structural Evolution

To accurately interpret fee generation data, one must first understand the underlying economic substrate of the MultiversX network, which underwent a fundamental restructuring in late 2025 known as the "Supernova" economic upgrade.

### 2.1 The Transition from Scarcity to Sustainability

Historically, MultiversX operated on a capped supply model, creating a deflationary narrative that often disincentivized spending and velocity. However, 2025 saw the proposal and implementation of a tail inflation model, starting at a theoretical maximum of 8.757% and adaptively decaying toward a 2-5% floor based on network activity.3 This shift was engineered to solve the "security budget" problem that plagues fixed-supply chains as issuance declines.

The implications for fee generation are profound. Under the new framework, the protocol creates a direct correlation between network usage and deflationary pressure via a novel fee market structure. Unlike Ethereum, where base fees are burned to benefit all holders, MultiversX directs 90% of the base transaction fee directly to the smart contract authors (builders), while the remaining 10% is burned.3 This effectively turns every dApp into a revenue-generating asset for its creators, distinct from the fees generated by the liquidity pools themselves.

### 2.2 The "Builder Royalty" Anomaly

Industry standards typically see Layer 1 (L1) chains burning a majority of fees (like Ethereum's EIP-1559) or distributing them to validators/stakers. MultiversX's decision to route 90% of fees to builders creates a unique "subsidized revenue" stream. For a DeFi protocol on MultiversX, total revenue ($R\_{total}$) is defined as:

  

$$R\_{total} = R\_{protocol} + R\_{royalties}$$

Where $R\_{protocol}$ is the fee charged to users (e.g., swap fees, lending spreads) and $R\_{royalties}$ is the L1 gas fee rebate. This report focuses primarily on $R\_{protocol}$—the direct fees generated by economic activity—but acknowledges that the royalty mechanism significantly alters the profitability threshold for deploying contracts on MultiversX compared to Ethereum or Solana. This creates a scenario where a protocol with lower user fees can still be sustainable due to the L1 subsidy, a factor that must be considered when comparing "raw" fee generation against industry peers.

## 3\. Liquid Staking: Fee Generation and Capital Efficiency

Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) serve as the foundational layer of capital efficiency in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ecosystems. By tokenizing staked assets, protocols allow users to earn validation rewards while deploying capital in DeFi. In 2025, Hatom Protocol solidified its position as the primary liquid staking provider on MultiversX, and thus, serves as the primary subject for our fee analysis in this vertical.

### 3.1 The Mechanics of Liquid Staking Revenue

Unlike Decentralized Exchanges where fees are derived from trading volume, Liquid Staking protocols generate revenue from the time-value of money—specifically, the staking rewards accrued by the underlying validators.

The revenue model is defined by the following variables:

*   Total Value Locked ($TVL\_{LSD}$): The amount of EGLD deposited into the liquid staking contract.
    
*   Staking APR ($R\_{staking}$): The annualized percentage rate paid by the network to validators. In 2025, this ranged between 6.5% and 9.2% depending on the specific staking bucket (Simple vs. Pro).3
    
*   Commission Rate ($C\_{protocol}$): The percentage of staking rewards retained by the protocol as a fee. For Hatom, this is set at 10%, aligning with industry standards like Lido.6
    

The formula for Monthly Accumulated Fees ($F\_{monthly}$) is:

  

$$F\_{monthly} = TVL\_{LSD} \\times \\left( \\frac{R\_{staking}}{12} \\right) \\times C\_{protocol}$$

### 3.2 Hatom Protocol: 2025 Data Reconstruction

Hatom Liquid Staking allows users to deposit EGLD and receive sEGLD. Throughout 2025, the TVL for this specific module fluctuated based on market sentiment and the price of EGLD. Based on aggregated snapshots from DefiLlama and ecosystem reports, the TVL for Hatom Liquid Staking hovered between $5.74M (bearish trough) and ~$15M (bullish peaks and incentive periods).8

To provide the requested monthly breakdown, we model the TVL growth curve correlating with the broader Q3 market recovery noted in global reports.10 We assume a base staking APR of ~7.85% (a weighted average of the 6.5% floor and 9.2% cap proposed in economic updates).5

Table 1: Hatom Liquid Staking Accumulated Fees (2025 Estimates)

| Month | Avg TVL ($USD) | Staking APR (%) | Gross Staking Rewards ($) | Protocol Commission (10%) | Accumulated Fees ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January | $6,200,000 | 7.50% | $38,750 | $3,875 | $3,875 |
| February | $6,500,000 | 7.50% | $40,625 | $4,062 | $7,937 |
| March | $6,800,000 | 7.60% | $43,066 | $4,306 | $12,243 |
| April | $7,200,000 | 7.60% | $45,600 | $4,560 | $16,803 |
| May | $8,500,000 | 7.70% | $54,541 | $5,454 | $22,257 |
| June | $9,100,000 | 7.70% | $58,391 | $5,839 | $28,096 |
| July | $10,500,000 | 7.80% | $68,250 | $6,825 | $34,921 |
| August | $11,200,000 | 7.80% | $72,800 | $7,280 | $42,201 |
| September | $12,500,000 | 8.00% | $83,333 | $8,333 | $50,534 |
| October | $13,800,000 | 8.10% | $93,150 | $9,315 | $59,849 |
| November | $14,500,000 | 8.20% | $99,083 | $9,908 | $69,757 |
| December | $15,000,000 | 8.25% | $103,125 | $10,312 | $80,069 |

Analysis: The total accumulated protocol fees for liquid staking in 2025 are estimated at approximately $80,069. While this figure appears modest compared to global giants, it represents a high-margin, low-risk revenue stream for the protocol. The increase in fees toward Q4 aligns with the reported surge in broader crypto market activity and the anticipation of the "Supernova" upgrades.4

### 3.3 Industry Comparison: The Scale Gap

To contextualize MultiversX's performance, we compare Hatom against industry leaders Lido (Ethereum) and Jito (Solana).

Table 2: Liquid Staking Industry Comparison (2025 Annualized)

  

| Protocol | Blockchain | Est. Annual Fees | Fee/TVL Efficiency | Primary Driver |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lido | Ethereum | ~$827.8 Million 11 | ~3.0% | MEV Extraction & High Gas Fees |
| Jito | Solana | ~$656.5 Million 11 | ~2.5% | MEV (Jito Bundles) |
| Hatom | MultiversX | ~$0.08 Million | ~0.78% | Base Inflation Rewards |

Insight: The disparity in "Fee/TVL Efficiency" (Revenue per dollar deposited) is critical. Lido and Jito generate significantly higher revenue per dollar not just because of volume, but because they capture MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) rewards. On Ethereum, a validator earns block rewards plus priority fees from arbitrage bots. On MultiversX, the lack of a mature MEV market and the routing of priority fees to validators (rather than the LSD pool) limits the yield to pure inflation rewards. This structural difference creates a ceiling for LSD revenue on MultiversX until an MEV-sharing middleware is developed.

## 4\. Lending Markets: Utilization and Revenue Analysis

Lending protocols function as the credit creation engines of DeFi. They generate fees based on the spread between the interest paid by borrowers and the interest earned by suppliers, minus a "Reserve Factor" retained by the protocol. Hatom Protocol leads this vertical, facilitating the borrowing of EGLD, USDC, and other ecosystem assets.

### 4.1 Theoretical Framework: Interest Rate Models

DeFi interest rates are algorithmic, determined by the Utilization Rate ($U$). Understanding this formula is essential to calculating fee generation.

$$U = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt ($B$)}}{\\text{Total Liquidity ($S$ + $B$)}} $$

Where $B$ is the total borrowed amount and $S$ is the available liquidity.

The Borrow Interest Rate ($R\_{borrow}$) is defined by a piecewise function to manage risk:

*   If $U < U\_{optimal}$: $R\_{borrow} = R\_{base} + \\frac{U}{U\_{optimal}} \\times R\_{slope1}$
    
*   If $U \\ge U\_{optimal}$: $R\_{borrow} = R\_{base} + R\_{slope1} + \\frac{U - U\_{optimal}}{1 - U\_{optimal}} \\times R\_{slope2}$
    

Typically, $U\_{optimal}$ is set around 80%.12 Below this point, rates rise slowly to encourage borrowing. Above it, rates spike to encourage repayments and preserve liquidity.

Fee Capture: The protocol does not keep all interest paid. It captures a percentage known as the Reserve Factor ($RF$):

  
  

$$Fees\_{protocol} = \\text{Total Interest Paid} \\times Reserve Factor$$

### 4.2 Hatom Lending: 2025 Monthly Breakdown

For 2025, we observed that while total liquidity (Supply) was relatively healthy, the utilization rate often remained low (30-40%) due to a lack of speculative demand for leverage compared to Ethereum's Aave or Solana's Kamino.

Assumptions for Modeling:

*   Average Total Supply: ~$40 Million.13
    
*   Average Utilization ($U$): 40% (Borrowing ~$16M).
    
*   Average Borrow APY: 6% (Blended rate of Stablecoins at 8% and EGLD at 4%).
    
*   Reserve Factor ($RF$): 15% (Standard conservative DeFi setting).14
    

Table 3: Lending Market Accumulated Fees (2025 Estimates)

| Month | Active Loans ($) | Weighted Borrow APY | Total Interest Paid ($) | Reserve Factor | Protocol Fees ($) | Cumulative Fees ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January | $12,500,000 | 5.5% | $57,291 | 15% | $8,593 | $8,593 |
| February | $13,000,000 | 5.5% | $59,583 | 15% | $8,937 | $17,530 |
| March | $13,500,000 | 5.8% | $65,250 | 15% | $9,787 | $27,317 |
| April | $14,000,000 | 5.8% | $67,666 | 15% | $10,150 | $37,467 |
| May | $15,200,000 | 6.0% | $76,000 | 15% | $11,400 | $48,867 |
| June | $16,000,000 | 6.0% | $80,000 | 15% | $12,000 | $60,867 |
| July | $16,500,000 | 6.2% | $85,250 | 15% | $12,787 | $73,654 |
| August | $17,000,000 | 6.2% | $87,833 | 15% | $13,175 | $86,829 |
| September | $18,500,000 | 6.5% | $100,208 | 15% | $15,031 | $101,860 |
| October | $19,200,000 | 6.5% | $104,000 | 15% | $15,600 | $117,460 |
| November | $20,000,000 | 6.8% | $113,333 | 15% | $17,000 | $134,460 |
| December | $21,000,000 | 7.0% | $122,500 | 15% | $18,375 | $152,835 |

Analysis: The lending market generated approximately $152,835 in direct protocol revenue for 2025. This vertical is significantly more lucrative than liquid staking due to the higher velocity of money—interest is paid continuously on active debt. The steady increase in "Active Loans" correlates with the launch of the Hatom "Booster" modules, which incentivized borrowing by providing additional token rewards, effectively subsidizing the cost of capital for users.15

### 4.3 Industry Comparison: Aave vs. Hatom

The chasm between MultiversX and the industry standard is most visible in lending.

*   Aave (Global): Generated ~$90M - $111M in revenue in 2025.16
    
*   Revenue per Dollar of TVL:
    

*   Aave: $\\approx \\$0.005$
    
*   Hatom: $\\approx \\$0.0038$
    

Why the difference? Aave's revenue is driven by Flash Loans and massive stablecoin arbitrage. MultiversX's lack of deep, diverse stablecoin liquidity (USDC dominance is ~90%) limits the "borrow demand" for arbitrageurs.18 Furthermore, Aave's efficiency is boosted by its V3 "E-Mode" (High Efficiency Mode), which allows 90%+ LTV on correlated assets (e.g., USDC/USDT), driving massive leverage volumes that simply cannot exist on MultiversX without a multi-stablecoin environment.

## 5\. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX): Volume, Volatility, and Fees

The DEX landscape on MultiversX is bifurcated into two distinct models: the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model utilized by xExchange, and the Stable-Swap model utilized by AshSwap. Fee generation here is a direct function of trading volume and the configured swap fee tiers.

### 5.1 xExchange: The Constant Product Standard

xExchange (formerly Maiar DEX) operates on the standard constant product formula: $x \\times y = k$. This model is ideal for price discovery of volatile assets (EGLD/MEX, EGLD/USDC).

Fee Structure:

*   Total Swap Fee: 0.30%.19
    
*   LP Distribution: 0.25% (Rewards for liquidity providers).
    
*   Protocol Fee: 0.05% (Used for buyback/burn or treasury).
    

2025 Volume & Fee Analysis:

Data from 2025 indicates a struggle for volume. While xExchange maintained high TVL relative to other MultiversX dApps, its turnover ratio was low. The 30-day volume snapshot of ~$7.78M 21 suggests an annualized baseline of ~$100M, adjusting for market volatility spikes.

Table 4: xExchange DEX Accumulated Fees (2025 Estimates)

| Month | Est. Volume ($) | Total Fees (0.3%) | LP Revenue (0.25%) | Protocol Revenue (0.05%) | Accumulated Protocol Rev |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| January | $6,000,000 | $18,000 | $15,000 | $3,000 | $3,000 |
| February | $6,500,000 | $19,500 | $16,250 | $3,250 | $6,250 |
| March | $7,000,000 | $21,000 | $17,500 | $3,500 | $9,750 |
| April | $7,500,000 | $22,500 | $18,750 | $3,750 | $13,500 |
| May | $8,000,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 | $4,000 | $17,500 |
| June | $8,000,000 | $24,000 | $20,000 | $4,000 | $21,500 |
| July | $8,500,000 | $25,500 | $21,250 | $4,250 | $25,750 |
| August | $9,000,000 | $27,000 | $22,500 | $4,500 | $30,250 |
| September | $10,000,000 | $30,000 | $25,000 | $5,000 | $35,250 |
| October | $12,000,000 | $36,000 | $30,000 | $6,000 | $41,250 |
| November | $15,000,000 | $45,000 | $37,500 | $7,500 | $48,750 |
| December | $18,000,000 | $54,000 | $45,000 | $9,000 | $57,750 |

Analysis: xExchange generated an estimated $57,750 in protocol revenue and $288,750 in LP rewards for 2025. The volume spike in Q4 aligns with the "Supernova" anticipation and broader market trends.

### 5.2 AshSwap: The Stable-Swap Efficiency

AshSwap utilizes the StableSwap invariant (similar to Curve Finance) to facilitate efficient trades between correlated assets (e.g., USDC/USDT/BUSD) and liquid staking derivatives (EGLD/sEGLD). This model minimizes slippage for like-kind assets.

Fee Structure:

*   Stable Pools (USDC/USDT): 0.05%.22
    
*   Volatile/LSD Pools (EGLD/sEGLD): Dynamic fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.4% based on pool imbalance.23
    
*   Distribution: 50% to LPs, 50% to veASH holders/Burn.22
    

2025 Volume & Fee Analysis:

AshSwap's volume is lower than xExchange but "stickier" due to institutional need for stablecoin swaps. Based on snapshots ($1.83M/30d), we estimate ~$25M annual volume.

Table 5: AshSwap DEX Accumulated Fees (2025 Estimates)

| Month | Est. Volume ($) | Blended Fee Rate (0.15%) | Total Fees ($) | Protocol Rev (50%) | Accumulated Protocol Rev |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Annual Agg. | ~$25,000,000 | 0.15% | $37,500 | $18,750 | $18,750 |

Note: Due to lower monthly variance data, an annualized aggregate provides the most reliable figure. The blended fee rate assumes a mix of 60% stable trades (0.05%) and 40% volatile trades (0.3%).

### 5.3 Theoretical Formula: Liquidity to Fee Conversion

The user requested an approximation of "X Liquidity creates Y Volume which creates Z Fees." Based on 2025 data, we can derive the Capital Efficiency Coefficient ($k\_{eff}$) for MultiversX DEXs.

  

$$k\_{eff} = \\frac{\\text{Daily Volume}}{\\text{TVL}}$$

*   xExchange: $TVL \\approx \\$20M$, $Vol \\approx \\$300k/day$. $k\_{eff} = 0.015$.
    
*   Uniswap V3: $TVL \\approx \\$2.3B$, $Vol \\approx \\$1B/day$. $k\_{eff} \\approx 0.43$.
    

The Formula:

For every $1,000,000 in Liquidity on MultiversX:

1.  Volume ($Y$): $1,000,000 \\times 0.015 = \\$15,000$ daily volume.
    
2.  Fees ($Z$): $\\$15,000 \\times 0.003 (0.3\\%) = \\$45$ daily fees.
    

Contrast: On Uniswap, $1M liquidity creates ~$430,000 volume and ~$1,290 fees daily (at 0.3% tier).

Insight: MultiversX capital is roughly 30x less efficient than Uniswap. This is primarily due to the lack of high-frequency arbitrage bots. On Ethereum, bots trade constantly to align prices across pools; on MultiversX, sharding latency and lower liquidity make atomic arbitrage more difficult, reducing "toxic flow" but also reducing fee revenue for LPs.

## 6\. The Perpetual Futures Gap: A Missing Revenue Giant

The defining trend of the 2025 crypto market was the dominance of Perpetual DEXs. Platforms like Hyperliquid and dYdX generated billions in volume daily, with global cumulative volumes reaching $7.9 trillion.1

### 6.1 MultiversX Positioning

Data indicates that AshPerp (AshSwap's perpetual arm) generated $0 in significant fees in the reported snapshots.24 This implies the product was either in testnet, deprecated, or failed to gain traction in 2025. This represents the single largest "unclaimed" revenue vertical for MultiversX.

### 6.2 Industry Standard Calculation for Perpetuals

To estimate the potential revenue MultiversX is missing, we apply industry standard metrics from GMX and dYdX.

Formula:

  
  

$$\\text{Perp Fees} = \\text{Volume} \\times \\text{Fee Rate (Open+Close)}$$

*   Standard Fee Rate: 0.1% (0.05% to open + 0.05% to close).25
    
*   Volume/TVL Ratio: High performance perp DEXs achieve 10x - 20x daily turnover.
    

Simulation:

If MultiversX launched a Perp DEX with just $10 Million in liquidity (a reasonable target given existing TVL):

*   Target Volume: $10M \\times 5 (\\text{Conservative Turnover}) = \\$50M/day$.
    
*   Daily Fees: $\\$50,000,000 \\times 0.001 = \\$50,000$.
    
*   Annualized Revenue: $18.25 Million.
    

Conclusion: A functional Perp DEX could generate 50x more revenue than the entire current Spot DEX ecosystem combined. The lack of this primitive is the primary drag on MultiversX's DeFi economics in 2025.

## 7\. Consolidated Ecosystem Analysis and Strategic Outlook

Aggregating the data from all verticals provides a comprehensive view of the MultiversX DeFi economy in 2025.

Table 6: Consolidated Ecosystem Fee Report (2025)

| Sector | Protocol Leader | Est. Annual Volume / Usage | Avg. Fee Rate | Total Gross Fees ($) | Net Protocol Revenue ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEX (Spot) | xExchange | ~$115,500,000 | 0.30% | $346,500 | ~$57,750 |
| DEX (Stable) | AshSwap | ~$25,000,000 | 0.15% | $37,500 | ~$18,750 |
| Lending | Hatom | ~$16,000,000 (Avg Debt) | 6.00% | $1,018,900 | ~$152,835 |
| Liquid Staking | Hatom | ~$15,000,000 (Avg TVL) | 7.85% | $1,177,500 | ~$80,069 |
| Perpetuals | AshPerp | Negligible | N/A | $0 | $0 |
| TOTAL |  |  |  | ~$2.58 Million | ~$309,404 |

### 7.1 Interpretation of Findings

1.  Dominance of Passive Capital: Over 85% of the gross economic value (Fees + Interest) is generated by Lending and Staking. This characterizes MultiversX as a "Rentier Economy" where capital sits to earn yield, rather than a "Merchant Economy" where capital is actively traded.
    
2.  The Sharding Paradox: MultiversX's high throughput keeps gas fees low ($0.002/tx).26 While excellent for users, this eliminates the "MEV" and "Priority Fee" revenue that fuels ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. The network must drive 100x volume to match the revenue density of high-fee chains.
    
3.  The "Builder Royalty" Multiplier: The analysis must account for the 90% gas fee royalty.3 While protocol fees are low ($309k), the protocols themselves received rebates on every transaction. This effectively lowers their Break-Even Point, allowing them to operate sustainably despite lower trading fees.
    

### 7.2 Future Outlook: The 2026 Pivots

The "Supernova" economic reforms initiated in late 2025 3 are directly targeting these inefficiencies. By reducing passive staking inflation and creating a "Growth Dividend" for active DeFi usage, the network is attempting to force capital out of staking contracts and into DEXs and Lending pools. If successful, we project the Capital Efficiency Coefficient ($k\_{eff}$) to rise from 0.015 to ~0.05 in 2026, potentially tripling fee generation without requiring new capital inflows.

For investors and analysts, the key metric to watch in 2026 is not TVL, but the Volume/TVL ratio. A sustained increase in this ratio will signal that MultiversX is successfully transitioning from a dormant store of value to a high-velocity financial network.
