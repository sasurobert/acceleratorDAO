Research Report: MultiversX DeFi Fee Generation (2025)
NOTE

Data Accuracy Disclaimer: Aggregated "annual 2025" data for specific MultiversX protocols is not publicly reported in unified financial statements. The figures below for MultiversX are projections and amortized estimates based on available Q4 2024 data, weekly snapshots from Jan 2026, and on-chain metrics found during research. Industry benchmarks are based on 2025 data from DefiLlama, Token Terminal, and protocol reports.

1. MultiversX DeFi Fee Estimation (Last 1 Year)
A. MultiversX Network (Base Layer)
Q4 2024 Fees: ~$167,300
Annualized Run Rate (2025 Estimate): ~$670,000 - $1,400,000
Basis: Q4 2024 data annualized, adjusted for reported 85% activity increase.
B. Liquid Staking (Hatom, Liquid, others)
Estimated TVL: ~$30M - $50M (Hatom)
Estimated Annual Fees: $100,000 - $200,000
Formula used: TVL * Staking APY (8%) * Protocol Commission (10%)
Calculation: $40,000,000 * 0.08 * 0.10 = $320,000 (Revenue split between protocol and node operators).
Pure Protocol Revenue: Typically ~5-10% of total rewards.
C. Lending (Hatom, Jewelswap)
Estimated TVL: ~$30M - $50M
Estimated Annual Fees: $50,000 - $150,000
Formula used: TVL * Utilization (30-50%) * Borrow APY (3-5%) * Reserve Factor (10-20%)
Basis: Industry standard lending utilization and fee models applied to MultiversX TVL.
D. DEX (xExchange, AshSwap, OneDex)
xExchange Fees:
Snapshot Data: ~$2,570 fees/week (Jan 2026).
Annualized Estimate: ~$130,000 - $150,000
AshSwap / OneDex:
Estimate: ~$50,000 - $100,000 (Based on relative volume to xExchange).
Total DEX Ecosystem Estimated Fees: $200,000 - $300,000
2. Industry Benchmarks & "The Formulas"
The following are industry-standard production formulas derived from analyzing major protocols (Aave, Lido, Uniswap, GMX).

A. Liquid Staking
Formula: Fees = TVL * Staking_APY * Protocol_Fee_Share

Industry Benchmark Ratio (Revenue / TVL): ~0.20%
Example: Lido Finance
Data: ~$80M Revenue on ~$40B TVL.
Input for Projection: For every $100M in TVL, expect ~$200k in annual protocol revenue.
B. Lending
Formula: Fees = TVL * Utilization_Rate * Borrow_APY * Reserve_Factor

Industry Benchmark Ratio (Revenue / TVL): 0.10% - 0.40%
Example: Aave
Data: ~$100M Revenue on ~$30B - $50B TVL.
Input for Projection: For every $100M in Lending TVL, expect $100k - $400k in annual protocol revenue.
Note: Highly dependent on asset risk parameters and utilization.
C. Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
Formula: Fees = Volume * Fee_Tier

Liquidity to Volume Efficiency: Daily_Volume = Liquidity * 0.1 to 0.5 (Varies by pair type, e.g., Stables vs. Volatile)
Volume to Fees: 0.05% - 0.30% (Depending on pool config)
Benchmark (Uniswap V3):
Fee / Volume: ~0.05% (blended average due to high stablecoin volume).
Input for Projection: $10M Liquidity -> $1M-$5M Daily Volume -> $500 - $15,000 Daily Fees.
D. Perpetuals (Derivatives)
Formula: Fees = Volume * (Open_Fee + Close_Fee)

Liquidity to Volume Efficiency: Extremely High (Capital Efficient)
Benchmark ratio: Daily_Volume = Liquidity * 5 to 20
Volume to Fees: ~0.05% - 0.10%
Benchmark (GMX / dYdX):
Volume / Fee Ratio: 1000:1 to 2000:1
Example: $1B Volume -> $500k - $1M Fees.
Liquidity Efficiency: $50M Liquidity can support $500M+ in daily volume due to leverage and recycling.
3. Summary Table: "Inputs to Outputs"
Category	Input (Liquidity/TVL)	Estimated Daily Volume (Multiplier)	Fee Rate (on Volume/TVL)	Annual Revenue per $10M TVL (Est.)
Liquid Staking	$10,000,000	N/A	~0.2% of TVL (Annual)	$20,000
Lending	$10,000,000	N/A	~0.25% of TVL (Annual)	$25,000
DEX (Spot)	$10,000,000	$1M - $5M (0.1x - 0.5x)	0.30% (of Volume)	$1,000,000+ (if active)
Perpetuals	$10,000,000	$50M - $100M (5x - 10x)	0.05% (of Volume)	$9,000,000+ (if active)
IMPORTANT

Perpetuals Insight: The data clearly shows that Perpetuals are the distinct revenue winner per dollar of liquidity. A $10M liquidity vault in a perp protocol (like GMX) can generate 50x-100x the fees of a passive lending vault because the same capital is re-used for high-leverage volume thousands of times a day.
